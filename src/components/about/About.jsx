                ChirpSAT is a web tool built for the amateur radio satellite
                community. Its primary function is to generate channels with
                Doppler shift correction that can be easily imported into{" "}
                <abbr title="customer programming software">CPS</abbr> and
                programmed to a radio.

                ChirpSAT is easy to use: from the <Link to="/">home</Link> page
                select your radio. This will load options specific to your radio
                and ensure that the <code>.csv</code> generated will be usable
                in your <abbr title="customer programming software">CPS</abbr>.

                With your radio selected, choose which satellites you would like
                to create channels for and program to your radio.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, choose which channel you would like to start with. If you
                already have channels programmed into your radio, you may want
                to start with a later, empty, channel. You can always change
                your channel numbering on your own either with a{" "}
                <code>.csv</code> editor like Excel or within your{" "}
                <abbr title="customer programming software">CPS</abbr>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Satellite up-link and down-link data for the satellites you've
                selected will be imported. You can manually override this by
                selecting the satellite dropdown, and choosing edit.
              </p>

              <p>
                Choose the power level you would like to use when transmitting.
                It is always recommended that you use the least amount of power
                needed to make a contact, which for satellites can be as little
                as 2 watts.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last step is to configure the naming convention of your
                channels. By default, channels will be named by the satellite
                name, and their channel offset relative to the center channel.
              </p>
              <samp>
                <p className="text-muted ms-5">AO-92 (-3)</p>
              </samp>
              <p>
                You can change the naming convention using{" "}
                <code>#keywords#</code>. The default naming is:
              </p>

              <p className="ms-5">
                &lt;<code>#satellite_name#</code>(<code>#channel_offset#</code>
                )&gt;
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, you'll export your channels into a <code>.csv</code>{" "}
                file which you can import into the{" "}
                <abbr title="customer programming software">CPS</abbr> of your
                choosing. If you've already created channels, you may want to
                export the existing channels into a <code>.csv</code>, and
                combine the two by copy-pasting from one to the other, and then
                import the new file.
