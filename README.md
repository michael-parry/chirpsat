# ChirpSAT

Simple satellite programming for radio amateurs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is it?

ChirpSAT is a web tool built for the amateur radio satellite community.
Its primary function is to generate channels with Doppler shift
correction that can be easily imported into CPS (customer programming
software) and programmed to a radio.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How do I use it?

ChirpSAT is easy to use: from the home page select your radio. This will
load options specific to your radio and ensure that the `.csv` generated
will be usable in your CPS.

If you've never programmed your radio before, check out\
[Powerwerx](https://powerwerx.com/help/two-way-radios)\
or\
[BridgeCom Systems](https://www.bridgecomsystems.com/pages/support)\
for support on your radio and a download link to the programming
software you need.

Alternatively, you can use third-party software like\
[CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home),\
but proceed at your own risk, the use of third-party software introduces
its own risks.

With your radio selected, choose which satellites you would like to
create channels for and program to your radio.

Next, choose which channel you would like to start with. If you already
have channels programmed into your radio, you may want to start with a
later, empty, channel. You can always change your channel numbering on
your own either with a `.csv` editor like Excel or within your CPS.

Satellite up-link and down-link data for the satellites you've selected
will be imported. You can manually override this by selecting the
satellite dropdown, and choosing edit.

Choose the power level you would like to use when transmitting. It is
always recommended that you use the least amount of power needed to make
a contact, which for satellites can be as little as 2 watts.

The last step is to configure the naming convention of your channels. By
default, channels will be named by the satellite name, and their channel
offset relative to the center channel.

    AO-92 (-3)

You can change the naming convention using `#keywords#`. The default
naming is:

    <#satellite_name#(#channel_offset#)>

Lastly, you'll export your channels into a `.csv` file which you can
import into the CPS of your choosing. If
you've already created channels, you may want to export the existing
channels into a `.csv`, and combine the two by copy-pasting from one to
the other, and then import the new file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How does it work?

Satellite data is acquired from
[SatNOGS DB](https://db.satnogs.org/),
and the up-link and down-link frequencies are used to automatically
generate channels with Doppler shift correction for easy programming.

ChirpSAT is built with
[React](https://reactjs.org/),
uses
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),
and contains icons from
[Font Awesome](https://www.fontawesome.com).

## Who made it?

ChirpSAT was created by Michael Parry
[KE8KDF](https://www.qrz.com/db/KE8KDF).

It was created to simplify the process of programming HTs that use a CPS, which are often frustrating and tedious
to use. If you'd like to keep up with the project, check it out on
[GitHub](https://github.com/michael-parry/chirpsat).
